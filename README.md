# I2S_transceiver

fixxing bugs

- checked stop and mute behavior 
- did better tbench
- assertions?
- what if? instead of OP.tranen use !stop. Not much changes just set stop high on reset done
- also need a reset diferent from the global one (resets fifos, counters, data registers but not control one?). done
