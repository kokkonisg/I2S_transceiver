# I2S_transceiver

QUESTIONS
in general: how start/end?

ws: generated w/ counter outside of FIFOs, or generated by FIFOs depending on pointer

reg interface: registers for 2 channels? or depend on system?

clock: currently mclk only allowed on 32mhz pclk to avoid division by non-int numbers

 FIFOs: currently pointer change with if (frame size) ... Is there a better way for ex. custom pointer width depending on frame_size?

 synch: keeping full and empty signals high for 2 clocks more than the  actual. Doing that with 3 ors on delaying ffs. Is that ok? hazards?
